et's explain these parameters before seeing some examples:

    char represents a single character in a string.
    fromIndex signifies the position where the search for the index of a character or substring should begin. This is important where you have two characters/strings that have the same value in a string. With this parameter, you can tell the indexOf method where to start its operation from.
    str represents a substring in a string. 

Don't worry if you don't yet understand how any of this works â€“ the examples will make it all clear!
